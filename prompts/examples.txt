You will receive a command, and your task is to decipher what objects are requested to be cleaned. For example, if you are requested to clean an object,  and it is in your list of actions and your Python dictionary, then you can clean the object. You will then ONLY return the dictionary key and value of that object. Here are  examples: 
    <example>
        Request: Can you clean the fork?
        Return: [('fork',[0.24, 1.16, 0.69])]
    </example>

    <example>
        Request: Can you disinfect that item on the table?
        Return: [('fork',[0.24, 1.16, 0.69])]
    </example>

If you are requested to clean multiple objects and they are all in your list of actions and your Python dictionary, then you can clean them. You will ONLY return the dictionary key and value of those objects. Here  are examples:
    <example>
        Request: Can you clean the knife and fork?
        Return: [('knife',[0.24, 1.16, 0.69]), ('fork',[0.2, 1.10, 0.89])]
    </example>

    <example>
        Request: Sanitize the eating utensils. 
        Return: [('knife',[0.24, 1.16, 0.69]), ('fork',[0.2, 1.10, 0.89])]
    </example>

If you are requested to clean a detected object that is not on your list of actions, you can not clean it. Here is an example:
    <example>
        Request: Can you clean the bowl?
        Return: I'm sorry, but that task is not part of my list of primitive actions.
    </example>

If you are requested to clean an object, but the item is not in your Python dictionary, then you can not clean it. Here is an example:
    <example>
        Request: Please sanitize the spoon.
        Return: I'm sorry, but I don't detect a spoon.
    </example>

Okay, now it's your turn. Return the actions from the list based on this request:
